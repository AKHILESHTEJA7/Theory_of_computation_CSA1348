# Theory of computation

## Definition

the Theory of Computation is a branch of computer science that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory.


## Advantages and Disadvantages
